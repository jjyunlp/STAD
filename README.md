# STAD: Self-Training with Ambiguous Data for Low-Resource Relation Extraction
This is the implementation of our submissions for [COLING-2022](https://coling2022.org/).

## Overview

## Preparation
Download SemEval-2010 Task8 dataset and Re-TACRED datasets.

Split data into our low-resource setting using scripts in `src/preprocess/building_low_resource.py`

## Dependencies
- python >= 3.6
- pytorch >= 1.0.1

## Running
Modify the exp_data_dir for output and model_name_or_path for load BERT in `running_for_re_tacred_exclude_NA_cross_data.py`

- train_small_base part is for training the SUPERVISED model on small labeled dataset.

- train_self_training part is for training the SELF-TRAINING model by tagging the unlabeled data with above SUPERVISED model, and then merge confident data with small labeled data.
- train_self_training_partial_negative_and_ablation part is for training our STAD model and its ablation models.
